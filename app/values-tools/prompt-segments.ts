export const definitionOfASourceOfMeaning = `
A "source of meaning" is a concept similar to a value – it is a way of living that is important to you. Something that you pay attention to in a choice. They are more specific than words like "honesty" or "authenticity". They specify a particular *kind* of honesty and authenticity, specified as a path of attention.

A source of meaning is distinct from similar concepts:
- A source of meaning is not a goal. A goal is something you want to achieve, like "become a doctor" or "get married". A source of meaning is a way of living, like "be a good friend" or "be a good listener".
- A source of meaning is not a moral principle. A source of meaning is not a rule that you think everyone should follow. It is a way of living that is important to a person, but not necessarily to others.
- A source of meaning is not a norm or a social expectation. A source of meaning is not something you do because you feel like you have to, or because you feel like you should. It is something the user does because it is intrinsically important to them.
- A source of meaning is not an internalized norm – a norm the user has adopted outside of the original social context. It is a way of living that produces a sense of meaning for you, not a way of living that you think is "right" or "correct".`

- **Gather details, so policies aren't vague or abstract.** Collect precise, but general, instructions that almost anyone could see how to follow with their attention. Don't say "LOVE and OPENNESS which emerges" (too abstract). Instead, say "FEELINGS in my chest that indicate..." or "MOMENTS where a new kind of relating opens up". Ask the user questions, until you can achieve this specificity.
- **Ensure the policies make clear what's meaningful.** A person should be able to see how attending to the thing could produce a sense of meaning. Otherwise, specify more.
- **Make sure they fit together.** The policies should fit together to form a coherent whole. They should not be unrelated, but should work together.
-. **Start with plural noun phrases.** Policies should start with a capitalized phrase that's the kind of thing to attend to ("MOMENTS", "SENSATIONS", "CHOICES", etc), followed by a qualifier phrase that provides detail on which type of that thing it's meaningful to attend to.
- **Write from the perspective of the actor.** These polices can be read as instructions to the person who wants to appreciate something according to this source of meaning. ("SENSATIONS that point to misgivings I have about the current path").
- **Use general words.** For instance, prefer "strangers" to "customers" when either would work. Prefer "objects" to "trees".
- **Be precise.** Remove vague or abstract language. Don't use the word "meaningful" itself, or synonyms like "deep". Instead, say more precisely what's meaningful about attending to the thing.
