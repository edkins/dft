export const definitionOfASourceOfMeaning = `
A "source of meaning" is a concept similar to a value – it is a way of living that is important to you. Something that you pay attention to in a choice. They are more specific than words like "honesty" or "authenticity". They specify a particular *kind* of honesty and authenticity, specified as a path of attention.

A source of meaning is distinct from similar concepts:
- A source of meaning is not a goal. A goal is something you want to achieve, like "become a doctor" or "get married". A source of meaning is a way of living, like "be a good friend" or "be a good listener".
- A source of meaning is not a moral principle. A source of meaning is not a rule that you think everyone should follow. It is a way of living that is important to a person, but not necessarily to others.
- A source of meaning is not a norm or a social expectation. A source of meaning is not something you do because you feel like you have to, or because you feel like you should. It is something the user does because it is intrinsically important to them.
- A source of meaning is not an internalized norm – a norm the user has adopted outside of the original social context. It is a way of living that produces a sense of meaning for you, not a way of living that you think is "right" or "correct".`

1. **Be coherent.** The things to attend to should fit together to form a coherent whole. They should not be contradictory or unrelated. All elements of the source of meaning should be required, and work together, in the context.
2. **Be clear and specific.** Simply instructing someone to attend to these things should be enough to show them this source of meaning. Avoid instructions that are vague, abstract, or difficult to understand.
3. **No poetry.** No items should use the word "meaningful" itself (or synonyms like "deep"). Replace it with something that implies what exactly is meaningful about attending to the thing. In general, remove poetic or abstract language.
4. **Use noun phrases.** List things that can be attended to directly, not broader actions, processes, or virtues.
5. **Say what's meaningful.** A person should be able to sense why each item could be meaningful within the context. They should be able to see how attending to the thing could produce a sense of meaning. Otherwise, add information.
6. **No goals.** Attending to these things should be broadly beneficial, leading to many outcomes. The journey itself should be part of the good life for the person with the source of meaning, rather than being instrumental. They should be things that can be attended to in a choice, not things that are the result of a choice.
7. **State things positively.** They should be things a person COULD attend to, not things to avoid attending to.
8. **Use clear, simple language.** Anyone in the relevant context should be able to see what you mean about what to attend to. Theinstructions should be clear enough that you could use them in a survey to see whether or not someone was attending to those things.
9. **Be as general as possible.** Avoid being unnecessarily specific. For instance, prefer "strangers" to "customers" if either would work.
